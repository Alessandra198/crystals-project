            <h3>Why Crystals?</h3>
            <h2>The history behind the properties of crystals</h2>
            <p>
              The first historical references to the use of crystals come from
              ancient the Ancient Sumerians, who included crystals in magic
              formulas. The Ancient Egyptians used stones primarily for
              protection and health. Green stones in general were used to
              signify the heart of the deceased and were included in burials.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Ancient Greeks attributed a number of properties to crystals
              and many names we use today are of Greek origin. The word
              'crystal' comes from the Greek word for ice, as it was believed
              that clear quartz was water that had frozen so deeply that it
              would always remain solid.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Alessandra Rinaldo and I'm very passionate about
              crystals! Since I was a child, every time I'd come home with
              pockets full of rocks. Now I have a pretty collection from all
              around the world that I'm really proud ofðŸ’œ
